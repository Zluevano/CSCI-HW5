If a test result is changed from a int to a char it bugs out. That is it doesn't display anything past the date which is a string so that wouldn't be affected, this is relevant if it's a blank space or a char for the test result, this isn't a bool as if you had 5 for a input it would assume 5 positive cases for one person aswell.
